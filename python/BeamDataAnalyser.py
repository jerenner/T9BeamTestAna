# New and final particle identification code, to be processed
# with the path to a config file, an example is 
# /config/analyse_000432.json to be used with
# python BeamDataAnalyser.py ../config/analyse_000432.json
# This code:
# 1. Opens the root file,
# 2.  identifies particles (based on hit time for the TG or particle selection cuts for the LM setup implemented in the config file, which should be based on 
# table "Selection cuts derived with integration windows of [-16 to 45ns] for all the datasets that are used for the beam flux studies"
# available in the beam flux technote: https://wcte.hyperk.ca/wg/beam/beam-test-2023/drafts/t9-beam-flux-technical-note.)
# 3. measures the TOF and associated momentum for each particle
# 4. produces many plots in the ../new_pdf(png)_results folders
# 5. outputs the number of particles, run characteristics, TOF and momentum information to the output file set in the config file
# written by acraplet, alie.craplet17@imperial.ac.uk
